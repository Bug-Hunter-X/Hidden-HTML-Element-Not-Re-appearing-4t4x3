# Hidden HTML Element Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed bug in HTML and JavaScript.  A div element is hidden using JavaScript, but the code lacks the functionality to make it visible again after being hidden.  The `bug.html` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.
